## 📖 Overview

GutVault is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to simplify the tracking of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms, meals, and bowel movements. Unlike traditional health trackers that store sensitive medical data on remote servers, GutVault utilizes a **local-first architecture** with **optional app lock security**.

All user data is stored persistently within the user's browser using **IndexedDB** (via Dexie.js), ensuring complete privacy and offline functionality. The application leverages **AI Voice Logging** to reduce the friction of manual entry. Users can speak naturally to describe their meals or symptoms, and the application uses an LLM (via OpenRouter) to parse the speech into structured data points automatically.

## ✨ Features

- **🛡️ Local-First Storage:** 100% of health data is stored locally on the device using IndexedDB (Dexie.js). Includes a **Storage Quota** view to track your data usage.
- **🔐 App Lock Security:** Optional PIN or biometric authentication to protect sensitive health data. Requires verification before disabling.
- **🌍 Multi-Language Support:** Full internationalization with **English** and **Greek** support. Switch languages seamlessly with the built-in language selector.
- **🎙️ Multi-Language AI Voice Logging:** - Speak naturally in **16+ languages** (English, Greek, Spanish, French, etc.).
  - **Review Mode:** Verify AI-parsed data against your raw transcript before saving to ensure accuracy.
  - Automatically extracts: Foods, Symptoms, Bristol Stool Scale, Pain Levels, and Medications.
- **🔔 Daily Reminders:** Built-in browser notifications to remind you to log your symptoms at a specific time every day.
- **📝 Comprehensive Manual Logging:** - **Bowel Movements:** Interactive Bristol Stool Scale visuals (Types 1-7).
  - **Symptoms:** Intensity sliders (1-10) with dynamic color coding and emoji indicators.
  - **Stress & Anxiety:** dedicated tracking with 1-10 stress slider and granular anxiety markers (e.g., "Overwhelmed", "Brain Fog").
  - **Meals:** Tag trigger foods (Gluten, Dairy, etc.) alongside free text.
  - **Medications:** Track names and dosages.
- **🧠 Smart FODMAP Analysis:**
  - **AI-Powered:** Uses LLMs to determine the FODMAP status of any food item.
  - **Language Aware:** Automatically detects and translates food names from your local language to English for consistent tracking.
  - **Local Caching:** Results are saved to your local database, making them instantly searchable for future entries without re-analyzing.
- **📈 Smart Correlations:** - Looks ahead 24 hours from every meal to detect associations with high pain or irregular bowel movements.
  - **Stress Analysis:** Identifies if high stress days are more likely to result in symptom flare-ups.
  - **Trigger Probability:** Visual bar charts showing the likelihood of specific foods causing symptoms.
- **🔍 Advanced History Management:** - Filter logs by **Date Range**, **Bristol Type**, or **Text Search** (find specific notes or foods).
  - Edit or delete any entry.
  - **Pagination** for smooth performance with large datasets.
- **📊 Dashboard Insights:**
  - **At a Glance:** Time since last BM, daily log count, and current pain level.
  - **Pain Trends:** 7-day interactive area chart.
- **💾 Import/Export:** - Full JSON backup and restore.
  - **PDF Reports:** Generate readable reports for your doctor (supports UTF-8 characters/Greek via custom font embedding).
  - **🩺 Doctor Sharing Mode:** Specialized export with:
    - **Trend Charts:** Visual Bristol Stool Scale and Symptom Frequency graphs.
    - **Smart Filtering:** Last 30/60/90 days view.
    - **Privacy:** Option to hide personal notes from the report.
- **📶 Offline PWA:** Installable on iOS/Android with locale-aware start URLs, fully functional without internet (sync required only for AI voice parsing).
